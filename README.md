# dotfiles

To import these dotfiles run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kruhlmann/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
chmod +x setup
./setup
```

Backups of the following files are stored in the [back](back) folder:

* ~/.bashrc
* ~/.profile
* ~/.bash\_aliases
* ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

After the setup has concluded you can simply edit the files in the repository directory as all configuration files are created as symbolic links pointing to the files in this folder.
