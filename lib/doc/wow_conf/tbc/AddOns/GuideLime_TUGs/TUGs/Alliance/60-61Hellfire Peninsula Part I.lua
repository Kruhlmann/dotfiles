I am leaving out EVERY Elite quest and most dungeons in this guide. especially on release YOU SHOULD NOT!!! You'll easily find groups for elite quests and dungeons. Do them as often as you can and at least once for their quests!
Run to [G63.5,17Blasted Lands]
Buy a Nethergarde Bitter and put it somewhere where you WILL NOT sell it, you will need it roughly at the end of lvl 60.

Start looking for a Ramparts (and best case scenario a blood furnace group right after) Dungeon group. Hellfire Peninsula won't get you fully to 62, so doing the dungeon is helping with this as Zangarmarsh is best done at lvl 62.
