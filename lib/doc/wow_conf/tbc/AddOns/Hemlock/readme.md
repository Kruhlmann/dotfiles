Hemlock - Minimalistic addon to automate poison buying and creation
---------------------------------------
This is a Classic fan update version of the addon Hemlock : https://www.wowace.com/projects/project-14170.

**Introduction:**

The entire idea is to make the entire poison-buying process as simple, fast, and brainless as possible.
It doesn't make you bother with ranks or anything - it assumes you want to refill your highest-rank poison to a threshold you set.

**How to use:**

1. Right-click to set the number of poisons you want to automatically buy and make.
2. Left-click to buy the exact amount of components for your poisons needs.
Hemlock also keep track of your inventory so it won't buy more reagents than needed!
3. Left-click again to automatically craft your poisons.

*/hemlock reset* to show all poisons and reagents buttons or use the ingame addon option menu.

**Lacking Features, Ideas & Problems**

The "ignore old poisons in inventory" option is not working properly, this is due to hemlock not knowing what poison rank you can craft when you open the vendor window.
