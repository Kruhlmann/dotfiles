Take the zeppelin to Undercity [QC64064]

Accept [QA5094]
Set hearth to [S Undercity][G67.7,38Undercity]
Ride out of the Undercity, follow the road east until you find the Bulwark [G83,68 Tirisfal Glades]. Pick the quest here and turn it in instantly to get your Argent Dawn Commission. When you kill undeads while having this trinket equipped, you can collect Scourgestones from their bodies. I suggest equipping it from now on everytime you kill undeads in eastern and western plaguelands.
*Turning in these Scourgestones at Argent Officer Pureheart gets you faction increases with the Argent Dawn and a token. These tokens are the only way to raise your faction with the Argent Dawn at a certain point in revered, so save them until then.*
Turn in [QT5094] and get [QA5096] from High Executor Derrington. 
Right-click the Box of Incendiaries next to him and loot the *Flame in a Bottle*. 
Ride east along the road and then north to the Scarlet Campment – northeast of Felstone Field – at [G41,54 Western Plaguelands]. Clear the camp and then right-click on the Command Tent and once it is destroyed right-click the Scourge Banner from your inventory for [QC5096].
Turn in [QT5096] and accept [QA5228]
Accept [QA5098]
Turn in [QT5228] and accept [QA5229]
Go east to Felstone Field [G37,58 Western Plaguelands]. Clear yourself a path to the Cauldron in the middle of the field, when you get close, Cauldron Lord Bilemaw will spawn, kill it and loot the Felstone Field Cauldron Key from him, then go to the cauldron and click it, turn in [QT5229] and get [QA5230]
In the Felstone Field, go to the houses on the north side of the field, enter the one which is the most to the west [G37,54 Western Plaguelands]. On the 2nd floor of the house you’ll find Janice Felstone, get the quest [QA5021]. Go to the next house which [G38,55 Western Plaguelands] and find Janice’s Parcel inside it. Click it, turn in [QT5021], then click it again and get [QA5023]
Turn in [QT5230] and accept [QA5231]
Ride east to Dalson’Tears [G45,52 Western Plaguelands], it’s the field directly east of Felstone Field. Clear yourself a path to the Scourge Cauldron, when you get close Cauldron Lord Malvinious will spawn, kill it and loot his key, go to the Cauldron and click it, turn in [QT5231] and get [QA5232].
Go to the houses on the north side of Dalson’s Tears, enter the right one [G47,51 Western Plaguelands]. Clear what’s inside and look on the floor for Mrs. Dalson’s Diary, get [QA5058]. Get out of the barn and look around for a Wandering Skeleton, there is only one of this kind and he roams around the barn, so keep killing stuff around the barn until you find it, kill it and loot “Dalson Outhouse Key”. Go behind the barn, you’ll find an Outhouse [G48,49 Western Plaguelands]. Open it, kill Farmer Dalson, loot Dalson Cabinet Key. Go to the other house now [G47,50 Western Plaguelands], on the 2nd floor of it you’ll find a “Locked Cabinet”, click it and turn in [QT5058].
Get out of Dalson’s Tears and go southwest to the Ruins of Andorhal. In Andorhal try to avoid the roads as much as possible, as level 56 elite abominations roam them. So just clear yourself a path through the destroyed houses. Also avoid the center of the town of course, there’s a huge bunch of mobs there and Araj the Summoner (lvl 61 elite).
Clear yourself a path to the first tower you see on your right-hand side [G42,66 Western Plaguelands], but be careful not to aggro the Skeletal Warlord inside of it (lvl 56-57 elite). You can drop the torch at the entrance of the watchtower without aggroing the Skeletal Warlord if you just get close to it without being in it’s line of sight. Look for the “beacon torch” in your inventory and click it while standing next to the tower’s door. You should get the message “Tower Two Marked” for [QC5098,2]
Go southwest to the next tower [G40,71 Western Plaguelands]. Place the beacon and you should get the message “Tower One Marked” for [QC5098,1]

Directly north of the cauldron in a small house you should find a tauren lying down on the floor, Mulgris Deepriver. Get [QA4984].
*From now on kill any diseased wolf you find on your way until you have completed [Q4984]*
Go north/northwest to an area just north of Dalson’s Tears [G45,40 Western Plaguelands], where you will find plenty of wolves to complete the quest. Kill everything in this area until you have 8 Diseased Wolf Kills for [QC4984]. If needed, you can go grind on the Scarlet Lumberjacks just north of this spot while waiting for the wolves to respawn.[O]
Accept [QA6004]
You can find the Scarlets Knights and Mages you need to kill for [QC6004,3][QC6004,4] just southeast of Kirsta, on the road to Hearthglen.
For the Hunters and Medics for [QC6004,1][QC6004,2] go to the camp further south and to the east [G51,44 Western Plaguelands].
Turn in [QT6004] and accept [QA6023]
Go back on the road just east of Kirsta. At [G54,34 Western Plaguelands] the road forks off to the left and right. Go right and up the slope you will find Huntsman Radley [G57,35 Western Plaguelands] for [QC6023,1]. She can be pulled solo if you do it at the right moment, just wait for the mage next to her to move far enough.
Get back on the main road and this time at the fork go north, keep going north until you hit the watchtower [G53,24 Western Plaguelands]. Kill the 2 guards in front of it, clear the 1st floor of the tower carefully, then wait for Cavalier Durgen to show up. He goes to the top of the tower then walks back to the entrance. Wait for him to come down, you can’t kill him when he’s on top, he has 3 guards with him there, kill him.[QC6023,2]
Turn in [QT6023]

Get out of the house and look for a Jabbering Ghoul wandering the area in front of the barn. If it's not there just keep the area clean until it respawns. Kill it and it will drop a "Good Luck Other-Half-Charm" for [QC5051]
Once you have the other half charm, go back to Janice Felstone, right click on the other-half-charm in your inventory. Turn in [QT5051]
Turn in [QT4984] and accept [QA4985]

Turn in [QT4985] and accept [QA4987]

Hearth to [H Undercity]
Deposit the *Glyphed Oaken Branch* in the bank.
Turn in [QT5236] and accept [QA5901]
Accept [QA5238] and turn [QT5238 it] back in[G83.1,68.9Tirisfal Glades].
Accept [QA4971]
Go to the northern gate of Andorhal, and east of the first watch tower you'll find two wooden silos [G45,62 Western Plaguelands]
Get full hp/mana, get next to one of them and click your Temporal Displacer (looks like a horn). 1 to 3 lvl 57 worms will spawn and attack you. When it's 3 it might be tough to handle solo, so always start those fights with full hp and if possible potions / long cooldown abilities up. Back off from the silos after you summon the worms, if you stay too close more worms will spawn sometimes, and that's probably more than you can handle solo.
The worms only appear when the silo is sparkling blue. They take a while to sparkle again after you use the temporal displacer next to them. There's 3 more silos just a bit more to the east.
Keep doing that until you have 15 Temporal Parasites slain for [QC4971]
Turn in [QT4971] and accept [QA4972]
Now what you have to do is to check every destroyed houses in Andorhal and look for *Small Lockboxes* and loot the Watches from them for [QC4972]
Turn in [QT4972]
*The Attuned Dampener you get as a reward is only usable on Araj the Summoner, so save it for later when you are 60 and do the big quests. Killing Araj is necessary to get your Scholomance key and another quest for a decent trinket. You'll need a solid group of 60s to kill him, but the Attuned Dampener will help.*
Now you should also have finished [QC964], if you haven't, kill some more skeletons while you are in Andorhal.
Turn in [QT5542][QT5543][QT5544]
Accept [QA5742] listen to him and then turn [QT5742 it] back in.
Accept [QA5781]
Go southeast to the Undercroft, which is directly south of the Marris Stead.
Behind the crypt in the Undercroft you'll find Tiron Fordring's Grave [G28,86 Eastern Plaguelands]. Next to should be a "Loose Dirt Mound". This is where you need help, this almost impossible to do solo unless you use a lot of creativity and everything you got. Anyway here is what happens when you click the dirt mount, Mercutio Filthgorger and 3 Dwarf Graverobbers spawn and go to the dirt mound, if you are close they of course jump you.
They all hit hard, especially Mercutio, and all have a lot of hit points for non elites. Here is what I suggest:
*As soon as you click the dirt mount, run to the other side of the fence, you can jump over it if you walk up the mountain a bit. The 4 dwarves will walk to the grave and stand there.*
*Ignore the 3 adds and go all out on Mercurio, loot the hammer for [QC5781] and run.*
Go inside the crypt [G27,85 Eastern Plaguelands], clear the way down, kill Zaeldarr the Outcast and loot his head for [QC6021]

Turn in [QT5781] and accept [QA5845]

Go west to the Plaguewoods. In the Plaguewoods look around for Large Termite Mounds and loot them for [QC5901]
Kill stuff inside Plaguewood while looking for those termite mounds, but also try to find as much *Cannibal Ghouls* as possible. Anytime you kill one of these, a Spirit of Darrowshire will appear, right click it to free it. You need to free *15 Darrowshire Spirits* for [QC5211]. The Cannibal Ghouls are not so numerous though, so it will take a while, consider this as a mini grinding session, plus you are getting faction with the Argent Dawn and Scourgestones.
Go east to the Quel'Lithien Lodge [G51,22 Eastern Plaguelands]. Clear yourself a path to the main building, and clear towards the right-hand wing. 
You should find two level 60 Quel'Lithien Protectors, kill them and then loot the Quel'lithien Registry for [Q6133], which should be lying on a bench.
Kill Elves for [QC6133]
Go east to Zul'Mashar [G64,24 Eastern Plaguelands]. Clear the way up the slope, and to the east, you'll soon face a big pyramid. At it's base you should see tombs with some trolls roaming about them. One of them is *Infiltrator Hameya*. Clear some of the trolls until you get a clear pull on Hameya, pull him solo and kill him, then loot his key for [QC6024]
Clear your way out of Zul'Mashar then go southeast to Northdale, take a dive in the pool which is just south of Northdale. Clear the elementals in the way. 
At [G71,33 Eastern Plaguelands], next to a cage you should see a white flag with a blue runed on it named *Symbol of Lost Honor*
Loot it for [QC5845]
Turn in [QT5211] at [G81,59 Eastern Plaguelands]
Ride west/southwest to Corin's Crossing, kill every undead you find there until you have 7 Living Rot. You must be rather quick because the living rot only lasts 10 minutes. As soon as you have 7, right-click the Mortar and Pestle from your inventory, you should receive some Coagulated Rot for [QC6022]
Ride west and slightly south to the Undercroft. Right behind the crypt in the Undercroft you should find a "Mound of Dirt". Not the one next to Tiron's grave, the other one close to a chariot [G28,86 Eastern Plaguelands]. Click it, turn in [QT6024]
Turn in  [QT6133][QT6042][QT6022]

Turn in [QT964] and accept [QA5514]
Go back to the Western Plaguelands and ride northeast to Northridge Lumber Camp. Go straight to the lumber mill which is at the northeastern tip of the lumber camp. Inside the lumber mill you should find a big crate named *Northridge Lumber Mill Crate*. Click it and place the Termite Barrel on it. A barrel with green smoke should appear, click it, turn in [QT5902] and get [QA6390]
Ride south, get back on the road, then go east for a while and then go south towards the isle of Caer Darrow. Swim southeast to Caer Darrow isle, on the western side of Caer Darrow, find *Artist Renfray* in a wooden house [G65,75 Western Plaguelands]. Turn in [QT5846] and get [QA5848]
