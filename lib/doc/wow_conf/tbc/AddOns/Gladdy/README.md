### Origin

Based on https://github.com/miraage/gladdy

### Motivation for this edit

The goal is to make Gladdy highly configurable in it's appearance. Everything can be arranged left or right independently. Also I gave Gladdy a new look with black borders. A lot can be configured.

### Modules:
- **Announcement** (drink, trinket usage, spec detection ...)
- **ArenaCountDown**
- **Auras** (show important (de)buffs as well as interrupts on the class icon)
- **BuffsDebuffs** (show buffs and debuffs on arena frames - can be filtered)
- **CastBar** (shows a castbar, can be disabled)
- **ClassIcon** (or specicon, once detected)
- **Clicks** (bind spells or macros to click actions)
- **CombatIndicator** (shows a sword icon if unit is in combat)
- **Cooldown** (tracks important cooldowns)
- **Diminishing** (tracks DRs)
- **ExportImport** (share your profile with your friends in the form of a string, which can be imported)
- **Highlight** (highlights focus and target)
- **Pets** (show arena pets)
- **Racial** (show arena racial cooldowns)
- **Range Check** (checks the range to a unit by a configurable spell)
- **Shadowsight Timer** (shows a little movable frame with time left until Shadow Eyes spawn)
- **TotemPlates** (show totem icons instead of normal nameplates, compatible with **Plater, NeatPlates, KUI, ThreatPlates, ElvUI, TukUI**)
- **Trinket** (tracks trinket usage)
- **VersionCheck** (checks if you use an older version that your teammate)
- **XiconProfiles** (predefined profiles to start your configuration from)

### Valid Slash commands

- **/gladdy ui** (shows config)
- **/gladdy test** (standard 3v3 test mode)
- **/gladdy test1** to **/gladdy test5** (test mode with 1-5 frames active)
- **/gladdy hide** (hides the frames)
- **/gladdy reset** (resets current profile to default settings)
